# FlowLoops ⏳🎲

> A weird little ADHD-friendly timer that hides the clock and gamifies your focus.

FlowLoops is a minimalist, installable, browser-based timer app. It tricks your brain into tracking time by hiding the countdown behind a randomized interface.

Built with React + Vite + TailwindCSS, it’s fully frontend — no accounts, no tracking, just you vs. the clock you can’t see.

## 🎮 How It Works

- Press **Run** → 8 random time intervals (2–21 min) are generated.
- One is secretly chosen and started.
- The remaining 7 fill mystery buttons.
- Click any button to:
  - Reset the hidden timer to that time
  - Replace that button’s value
- When the hidden timer ends:
  - You get a notification
  - A random button is "auto-clicked"
- You can’t see the timer. That’s the whole point 😄
